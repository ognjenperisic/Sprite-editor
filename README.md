# Sprite-editor
The Sprite editor. It is a simple drawing program when I was in high school. I made it because I wanted to write a simple 2D video game. At that time I had a Hercules Graphic card (286/12MHz DOS machine with 1MB of RAM and 40 MB Hdd, so the sprite editor is withiut colors.

(As a side note. I had to play with DosBox to make this code running. Furthermore, had to play with Turbo Pascal 5.5 to compile the code. I thought it will take me an hour or so. It took me 3 hours. It's been 15 years since I used Pascal.)
