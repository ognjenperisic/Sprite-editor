# Sprite-editor
The Sprite editor. It is a very simple drawing program I made when I was in high school. I made it because I wanted to write a 2D video game. At that time I had a Hercules Graphic card (286/12MHz DOS machine with 1MB of RAM and 40 MB HDD) so the sprite editor has no colors (black & white).

The screenshots from the editor are below.

(As a side note. I had to play with DosBox to make this code running. Furthermore, had to install Turbo Pascal 5.5 to compile the code. It took me some time to fiish everything. It's been quite some time since I used Pascal last time.)
